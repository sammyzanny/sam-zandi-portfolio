      <p>Hi, I'm Sam Zandi, welcome to my portfolio. Some things to know about me:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>I am a graduate from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a Bachelor of Science in Engineering Physics</li>
      </ul>
      <p>

I enjoy being challenged and am especially drawn to knowledge of how things work. This is what initially drew me towards Physics. After graduation I spent some time doing work with children teaching awesome early programming concepts and eventually I also became a Physics tutor. I was able to educate students in Chicago Public Schools who often do not get the opportunity to learn about programming and what it can do for you. This was perfect for me because I loved the work and also started to become more and more interested in programming until I eventually decided to enroll in Flatironâ€™s Software Engineering Bootcamp. 

Initially I loved software development because I love to solve problems, but as I learned more and began to create my own applications, I developed a new love for the creative side of software development. As I have grown older, I feel more in touch with my artistic side and I would love to be able to work at a company with the same values.

I made some pretty interesting apps in my time at Flatiron. Breakdowns of my apps and demos are available on the apps tab.</p>

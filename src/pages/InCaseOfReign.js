// In Case of Reign is a single-page-app game designed by Matt Gizzi and me. In this game you play as a Ruler/King/Queen of a kingdom. You select the cases/bundles of cases you would like to be faced with. Your initial approval rating depends on the cases you select. Each decision affects your approval rating differently. If you get through all the selected cases without your approval rating dropping to zero, you win! You can create your own cases and bundle them up with a theme as well in the case creation menu.
